  Solar Irradiance Prediction using Attention-SolarMeNet

  <h2>What is SolarMeNet?</h2>
  <p>SolarMeNet is a hybrid deep learning model developed to improve the prediction of solar irradiance using time-series meteorological and irradiance data. It combines the feature extraction strength of CNN-based SolarNet with the temporal learning capabilities of the LSTM-based RadiMeNet, enhanced further by an attention mechanism. This design allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the data, improving prediction accuracy and training efficiency.</p>

  <h2>Why was SolarMeNet developed?</h2>
  <p>The integration of renewable energy, particularly solar power, poses challenges for energy grid stability due to fluctuations in irradiance. Traditional forecasting models often fall short in handling temporal dynamics and multi-feature dependencies. Attention-SolarMeNet was created to address these issues by learning spatial-temporal patterns and emphasizing key features through attention, leading to more reliable predictions for grid managers, solar farm operators, and environmental strategists.</p>

  <h2>How was the model designed and trained?</h2>
  <p>The architecture consists of three key components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SolarNet:</strong> A Conv1D network extracting local spatial features from input time-series data.</li>
    <li><strong>RadiMeNet:</strong> An LSTM layer designed to capture sequential dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Attention Layer:</strong> Adds interpretability and focus by weighting features dynamically.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Training utilized two open-source datasets from GitHub. Data preprocessing included null value imputation, normalization, and feature engineering. An 80:20 split was used for training and validation. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, MSE loss, 60 epochs, and batch size of 32.</p>

  <h2>What were the results?</h2>
  <p>SolarMeNet outperformed baseline models across all metrics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dataset 1:</strong> MAE = 0.065, MSE = 0.009, RMSE = 0.098, R² = 0.852</li>
    <li><strong>Dataset 2:</strong> MAE = 0.039, MSE = 0.006, RMSE = 0.081, R² = 0.829</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Visualizations of SHAP values, MAE loss curves, and prediction overlays confirm the model's stability and generalizability.</p>

  <h2>What impact does this project have?</h2>
  <p>This work provides a reliable tool for solar output forecasting with high interpretability. It aids solar energy integration into smart grids, improves energy trading strategies, and supports environmental monitoring initiatives.</p>
