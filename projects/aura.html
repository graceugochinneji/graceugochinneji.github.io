  <h2>What is SolarNow-Attn?</h2>
  <p>
    SolarNow-Attn is a deep learning-based system for real-time solar irradiance prediction using radiance sky images. It integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Attention mechanisms to forecast photovoltaic (PV) output under dynamic weather conditions.

  </div>

  <h2>Why was SolarNow-Attn developed?</h2>
  <p>
    Accurate solar energy forecasting is vital for maintaining grid stability, especially in areas with high solar penetration. Traditional models relying on historical weather data struggle with real-time adaptability. SolarNow-Attn addresses this by leveraging attention-based CNNs to dynamically interpret cloud patterns and irradiance levels from sky imagery.
  </p>

  <h2>How was the dataset collected and prepared?</h2>
  <p>
    Two datasets from Stanford were used, consisting of high-resolution (2048×2048) fisheye sky images sampled every minute, alongside corresponding PV output data. Preprocessing steps included image resizing (64×64), normalization, alignment of images and PV output, and 10-fold cross-validation with temporal grouping.
  </p>

  <h2>What model architecture was used?</h2>
  <p>
    The model uses two CNN blocks with batch normalization, followed by SE-Attention layers to recalibrate channel features. The extracted features are fed through two fully connected layers with dropout regularization. The final node outputs a single regression value representing solar energy potential.
  </p>

  <h2>Which hyperparameters and tools were used?</h2>
  <p>
    Training was performed using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 3×10⁻⁶ and batch size of 32. Dropout rate was set to 0.4. The code was implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and run on a system with Intel i7 CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU.
  </p>

  <h2>How well did the model perform?</h2>
  <p>
    Across all metrics, CNN + SE-Attention outperformed baseline models. On Dataset 1, it achieved RMSE of 2.231 and MAE of 1.311. Sunny condition predictions had RMSE < 0.51, while cloudy scenarios showed higher variance. Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed that the model focuses on meteorologically relevant regions like solar disks and cloud edges.
  </p>

  <h2>What are the conclusions and next steps?</h2>
  <p>
    The system provides reliable, interpretable, and efficient short-term solar forecasting. Limitations include reduced generalization on unfamiliar datasets and GPU dependency. Future improvements involve introducing temporal models (ConvLSTM), building lightweight mobile variants, and incorporating hybrid Transformer-CNN architectures.
