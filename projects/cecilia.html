  Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Using Triple Fusion Explainable Model
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
  <p>This project by Cecilia Chu presents a novel deep learning approach for predicting protein secondary structure. The model, termed the Triple Fusion Explainable Model, integrates a Convolutional Structural Predictor (CSP), a Self-Attention CSP, and a Memory-Based Network. The model provides interpretable predictions via SHAP visualizations, enabling better understanding of structural patterns from protein sequences.</p>

  <h2>How was it implemented?</h2>
  <p>The proposed model combines three components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CSP:</strong> Extracts spatial features through convolutional layers.</li>
    <li><strong>Attention-CSP:</strong> Enhances CSP with self-attention mechanisms.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory-Based Network:</strong> Uses recurrent memory cells to retain long-term dependencies in protein sequences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Training included real-time data augmentation, dropout regularization, and early stopping. The datasets were preprocessed with normalization and sequence filtering. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, AUC, and SHAP interpretability scores.</p>

  <h2>What were the key results?</h2>
  <p>The model achieved over 95% accuracy and AUC across both datasets. SHAP bar, dot, and waterfall plots revealed which features most influenced the structure classification.</p>

  <h2>Application & Future Work</h2>
  <p>A user-friendly GUI was developed to allow researchers to input protein sequences and receive predicted structures with SHAP-based insights. Future enhancements may include multi-modal sequence alignment, 3D structural prediction, and incorporation of protein function annotations.</p>
